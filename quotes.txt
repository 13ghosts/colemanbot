I HATE DIETING!
YEAAAAAAAH BUDDAYYYY!
AIN'T NOTHING TO IT BUT TO DO IT!
KNOWLEDGE IS THE REAL POWER!
EVERYBODY WANNA BE A BODYBUILDER, BUT DON'T NOBODY WANNA LIFT NO HEAVY ASS WEIGHTS!
AIN'T NUTTIN' BUT A PEANUT!
LIGHTWEIGHT!
THANK GOD FOR PURE NATURAL STRENGTH.
I'VE BEEN IN PAIN FOR SO LONG NOW I'M JUST USED TO IT!
I EAT CHICKEN AND RICE, STEAK, AND BAKED POTATO. THAT'S IT!
PROGRESS TAKES TIME AND DISCIPLINE!
HARD WORK AND TRAINING - THERE IS NO SECRET FORMULA!
WHEN YOU HIT FAILURE YOUR WORKOUT HAS JUST BEGUN
WOMEN REALLY DO PAY ATTENTION TO A MAN'S GLUTES! A TIGHT, COMPACT ASS IS OFTEN MORE DESIRABLE THAN MUSCULAR ARMS OR CHEST! SO IF YOU'RE LACKING, START SQUATTING!
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF WIDE-GRIP PULL-UPS TO DEVELOP WIDTH AND SIZE!
JUST CAUSE YOUR TRICEPS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND YOUR BICEPS, DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BACK OFF YOUR TRICEP WORKOUTS!
I'M ATTAINED MY MASS BASICALLY BY TRAINING HARD AND VERY, VERY HEAVY!
